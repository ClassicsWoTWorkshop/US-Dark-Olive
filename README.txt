Thank you for downloading!

To install:
- Drag the files from inside the MAIN MOD (INSTALL THIS FIRST) - COLOR CHANGE folder to your World of Tanks install directory (by default, C:\Games\World_of_Tanks).
Optional:
- If you want to also remove the skin from the T26E5 Patriot or Chrysler K GF, drag the "res_mods" folder from inside the "ADDON - Remove T26E5 Patriot skin" or "ADDON - Remove Chrysler K GF skin (original by Avalon304)" folder to your World of Tanks install directory as well. 

Enjoy!
