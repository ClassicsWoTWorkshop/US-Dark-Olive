Thank you for downloading!

To install:
- Drag the files from inside the MAIN MOD - COLOR CHANGE folder to your World of Tanks install directory (by default, C:\Games\World_of_Tanks).
Optional:
- If you want to also remove the skin from the T26E5 Patriot, drag the "res_mods" folder from inside the ADDON - REMOVE T26E5 PATRIOT SKIN folder to your World of Tanks install directory as well. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: Only the tanks that are currently in HD have the color swap. The non-HD tanks still have their default brown drab color. Since WG is going to rework them into HD at some point anyways, I'd rather not have to re-do the mod twice for those tanks. Plus, the color shows up weird since they use the old model/texture system.

Enjoy!
